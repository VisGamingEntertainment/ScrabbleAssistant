# Scrabble Assistant App
Coded using VB 2010

This app allows the user to track their gameplay by displaying their current score and (in some modes) their remaining time. Apart from the classic Scrabble gameplay, there is also other ways of play in which this app supports 4 so far:
- Original
- Time Limited
- Score Madness
- Challenge

In each mode, the app will always show the player's scores. Some modes of play also have different actions that can be done within the app. For example, in Score Madness, you can trade your scores with a letter (random or selected)

In each mode, the winner is the one with the highest score:
- when all letters ran out or there's not enough space on the board (Original and Score Madness);
- when the time ran out (Time Limited); or
- when all the objectives have been completed (Challenge)
